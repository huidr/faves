## Faves

As an admirer, follower, critic of literature and media, I have tried to rank some of the most important works published or released in these human endeavours. My ranking is merit-based with a thorough research about the work, the background and its impact, and with as little bias as I could afford. It should be noted, however, that despite any amount of effort, such a ranking is bound to be inherently subjective.

Some of the lists are marked "Very loosely ranked" because a merit-based ranking is almost impossible but an attempt has been made.

### Literature

- [Fiction Books](Literature/fiction-books.csv) (includes both literary novels and genre novels, but I am more of a fan of the former; also includes novellas)
- [Very loosely ranked] [Poetry](Literature/poetry.csv)
- [Short Stories](Literature/short-stories.csv) (also includes novelettes)

### Media

- [Anime Series](Media/anime-tv-series.csv) (check out ronhuidrom@MAL as well)

### Extras

- [The works of Fyodor Dostoevksy](Extras/Dostoevsky-works.csv) (includes both novels and short stories)
- [The movies of Johnny Depp](Extras/Depp-movies.csv) (counts both his performance and the overall greatness of the movie with considerably more importance on the former)
