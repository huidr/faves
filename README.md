## Faves

As an admirer, follower, critic of literature and media, I have tried to rank some of the most important works published or released in these human endeavours. My ranking is merit-based with a thorough research about the work, the background and its impact, and with as little bias as I could afford. It should be noted, however, that despite any amount of effort, such a ranking is bound to be inherently subjective.

Some of the lists are marked "very loosely ranked" because a merit-based ranking is almost impossible but an attempt has been made.

Goodreads and Letterboxd have made this repo quite primitive :( but that's for the better :).

### Books & Literature

- [Biographies & autobiographies](Books/biographies.csv) [very loosely ranked]
- [Fiction books](Literature/fiction-books.csv) (check out [www.goodreads.com/ronaldhuidrom](https://www.goodreads.com/ronaldhuidrom) as well)
- [Poetry](Literature/poetry.csv) [very loosely ranked]
- [Short stories](Literature/short-stories.csv) [very loosely ranked](also includes novelettes)

### Media

- [Anime movies](Media/anime-movies.csv) (check out ronhuidrom@MAL as well)
- [Anime & donghua series](Media/anime-tv-series.csv) (check out ronhuidrom@MAL as well)

### Extras

- [The works of Fyodor Dostoevksy](Extras/Dostoevsky-works.csv) (includes both novels and short stories although it might be a bit unfair to the stories to rank them together with the novels!)
- [James Stewart movies](Extras/Stewart-movies.csv) (counts both his performance and the overall greatness of the movie with considerable importance on the former)
- [Johnny Depp movies](Extras/Depp-movies.csv) (counts both his performance and the overall greatness of the movie with considerable importance on the former)
- [Sherlock Holmes short stories](Extras/Sherlock-Holmes-short-stories.csv)
