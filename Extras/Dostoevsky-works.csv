1, The Brothers Karamazov, Novel, 1880, "Literary, philosophical, suspense", "Faith vs. reason, morality, suffering, envy",
2, Crime and Punishment, Novel, 1866, "Psychological, crime, philosophical", "Alienation, morality, guilt, free will", "Dostoevsky's deep dive into criminal psychology, free will, the main character's intent to handle guilt on his own, exquisite scenes and occasional humour are only a few of the many wonderful things about this literary masterpiece."
3, Notes from Underground, Novella, 1864, "Philosophical, existentialism", "Isolation from modern society, spite", "The Underground Man is alienated from the human world perhaps owing to him being too conscious, nihilistic and spiteful. Then he goes out and interacts with society and ends up making a mess of himself. Through this, Dostoevsky seemingly tries to ridicule nihilism and egoism."
4, White Nights, Short story, 1848, "Romance", "Lonliness, love", "As one of Dostoevsky's early works, the writing sort of foretells the more matured but similar writing of Notes from Underground. The ending is beautiful and bittersweet; happiness is a choice, something we find within."
 , The Dream of a Ridiculous Man, Short story, 1877, "Philosophical, existentialism", "Nihilism, suicide, utopia, suffering", "Dostoevsky may be trying to give meaning to human life as opposed to nihilism; despite suffering and imperfections, humans are capable of changing themselves and making the world a paradise."
