Prometheus, 2012, "Sci-fi, horror", 3.25/4, "Original, intriguing, clever. Leaves more questions than answers. Boasts Fassbender's wonderful portrayal of an android!"
Alien: Covenant, 2017, "Sci-fi, horror", 3/4, "A somewhat predictable plot yet satisfying, enjoyable and wonderful acting performance from Fassbender in a space-terror, tying the story to the Alien franchise."
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, 2016, Fantasy, 3/4, "An enjoyable and visually pleasing fantasy movie of magical creatures, with a powerful cameo from Depp."
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, 2018, Fantasy, 2/4, "Pleasant and entertaining in its own right, but doesn't live up to its predecessor."
