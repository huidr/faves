In the Mood for Love, 2000, "Romance, drama", 4/5, "Unique, intimate, one of a kind. The movie feels sensual, romantic and has a bittersweet ending."
A Beautiful Mind, 2001, "Biographical, drama", 4/5, "It's quite rare for a biopic of a mathematician to be this good."
Troy, 2004, "Historical, war", 2/5, "Enjoyable and entertaining. The battle scenes are well filmed and Brad Pitt plays Achilles well. Apart from that, the movie feels low-key ordinary."
Batman Begins, 2005, "Superhero", 4/5,
