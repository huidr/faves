Casino Royale, 2006, Spy, 5/5, "Craig reinvents Bond's character in this lovely, action-packed, beautifully scripted first-rate spy movie. Clever, gripping, hilarious at times, and truly entertaining overall."
Quantum of Solace, 2008, Spy, 3.5/5, "Barring being much more action-packed, this movie lacks many of the great things its predecessor had---humor, cleverness, smart screenplay and great chemistry."
