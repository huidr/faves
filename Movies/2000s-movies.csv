Movie, Year, Genre, Rating, Thoughts
American Psycho, 2000, "Satirical, psychological horror", 3/5, "Despite being violent and disturbing, the movie delivers a good blend of humor and horror, backed by Christian Bale's good and creepy acting."
In the Mood for Love, 2000, "Romance, drama", 4/5, "Unique, intimate, one of a kind. The movie feels sensual, romantic and has a bittersweet ending."
A Beautiful Mind, 2001, "Biographical, drama", 4/5, "It's quite rare for a biopic of a mathematician to be this good. T"
Troy, 2004, "Historical, war", 2/5, "Enjoyable and entertaining. The battle scenes are well filmed and Brad Pitt plays Achilles well. Apart from that, the movie feels low-key ordinary."
Batman Begins, 2005, "Superhero", 4/5, 
Casino Royale, 2006, Spy, 5/5, "Craig reinvents Bond's character in this lovely, action-packed, beautifully scripted first-rate spy movie. Clever, gripping, hilarious at times, and truly entertaining overall."
Into the Wild, 2007, "Biographical, adventure", 3/5,
The Dark Knight, 2008, Superhero, 5/5, "A superhero gem of a movie, it boasts exquisite scenes, well-written script and powerful acting especially Heath Ledger's."
Quantum of Solace, 2008, Spy, 3/5, "Enjoyable and entertaining but barring being much more action-packed, this movie lacks many of the great things its predecessor had: humor, cleverness, smart screenplay and great chemistry."
World's Greatest Dad, 2009, "Satirical, black-comedy", 3/5 , "Hilarious and enjoyable, backed by a clever script and Robin William's good performance."
