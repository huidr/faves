The Shop Around the Corner, 1940, "Comedy, romance", 5/5, "Hilarious, exquisite and witty. Memorable scenes, clever screenplay and masterful acting performances make this a romantic comedy in the truest sense and of finest quality. Jimmy Stewart has his usual charm and Margaret Sullavan is phenomenal. A great Christmas movie as well."
